          1 year internship in a big consulting firm as a hybrid apps developer/researcher.

          <p>
            During this 1-year internship in the Smart Mobility working group within the Solutions Delivery and Architecture department at Atos in the central offices in Madrid, I did develop my very first skills as an engineer. Learnt new technologies, researched a lot, took part in several projects, attended courses and, most of all, soaked in a real business environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a non-comprehensive list of some of the things I did:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Design and development of mobile hybrid apps: using Apache Cordova, common web technologies and some specific light frameworks like jQueryMobile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automated mobile application testing: using Calabash and Cucumber to write tests following a BDD approach which at the time allowed us to both test hybrid and native mobile apps in all platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rapid Prototyping in which I used Axure RP, Appery and Pencil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Web Services testing: i.e. SOAP Web Services using SoapUI.
            </li>
            <li>
              Projects: the most important project was a prototype hybrid Android app for Correos (an important client, the equivalent of Royal Mail UK in Spain) to be used in dedicated tablets in post offices to for customer self-service.
