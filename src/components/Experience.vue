            Typeless had this idea of being a contacts aggregator (<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/typeless" target="_blank">Typeless at Product Hunt <font-awesome-icon :icon="['fal', 'external-link']"/></a>). The founders were based in London and a team of developers worked remotely from India.

            I helped both filling the gap between the 2 teams and getting a complex idea and a set of features into a simple and intuitive user experience.

          1 year internship in a big consulting firm as a hybrid apps developer/researcher

        <div class="description">
          <p>
            During this 1-year internship in the Smart Mobility working group within the Solutions Delivery and Architecture department at Atos in the central offices in Madrid, I did develop my very first skills as an engineer. Learnt new technologies, researched a lot, took part in several projects, attended courses and, most of all, soaked in a real business environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a non-comprehensive list of some of the things I did:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Design and development of mobile hybrid apps: using Apache Cordova, common web technologies and some specific light frameworks like jQueryMobile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automated mobile application testing: using Calabash and Cucumber to write tests following a BDD approach (Behaviour-Driven Development) which at the time allowed us to both test hybrid and native mobile apps in all platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rapid Prototyping: used Axure RP, Appery and Pencil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Web Services testing: i.e. SOAP Web Services using SoapUI.
            </li>
            <li>
              Projects: the most important project was a prototype hybrid Android app for Correos (an important client, the equivalent of Royal Mail UK in Spain) to be used in dedicated tablets in post offices to let customers buy most of the services.
