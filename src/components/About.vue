    <h1>about this site</h1>
    <p>
      This site is a PWA made with Vue CLI 3 (so Vue.js + Webpack), hosted in Bitbucket/GitHub and deployed with Netlify.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could have just been one HTML5 page plus some vanilla JS and CSS in a normal server, but automating both the development workflow with the webpack based Vue CLI dashboard and the deployment plus lots of other perks from Netlify's free tier is just a breeze and very educational.
    </p>
    <p>
      Netlify has snippet injection, so Google Analytics is added during deployment that way, and my e-mail address and phone number are behind AWS Lambda cloud functions, also served by Netlify. It all costs zero, nada, gratis! The only unnecessary luxury is the domain, for which I pay around Â£8 per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also trying to demonstrate that content <em>&mdash;what&mdash;</em> and style <em>&mdash;how&mdash;</em> are two logically detached layers of web design.
