        Hi, my name is <b>Daniel Vivar</b> and I'm a front-end web engineer and designer based in London since 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting as a graphic designer while graduating in Computers Engineering, I then steered my career towards <b>front-end web engineering</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can work on anything related to web apps, considering myself both a UI/UX designer, a full-stack web engineer and a QA automation engineer, but if I had to choose I'd rather focus on front-end technologies.
