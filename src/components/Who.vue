        Hi, my name is <b>Daniel Vivar</b> and I'm a <b>senior front-end web engineer</b> with <b>+{{ new Date().getFullYear() - 2013 }}</b> years of experience in businesses that range from e-health to banking.

      <p class="no-print">
        At work, I focus on software craftmanship and lean approaches, embracing open web standards, re-use proven patterns, focus on the business goals, keep my team happy and make my managers proud. I taught front-end development at a tech academy in Madrid and help maintain open source projects whenever I can.
