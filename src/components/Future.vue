    <h1>what I'm looking for</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I love to learn new things all the time so my future company should be a place where <u>learning</u> and sharing knowledge <u>is actively encouraged</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel specially motivated in projects where I could create <u>delightful user experiences</u> for great apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also value an <u>open-minded culture</u>, flexibility, a healthy environment, a focused team and companies where technology is the heart.
