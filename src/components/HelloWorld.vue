      <h1>who I am</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Daniel Vivar and I'm a front-end web engineer and designer based in London since 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally a graphic designer and a computers engineering student, I then decided to focus my career into front-end web engineering.

    <section id="future">
      <h1>what I'm looking for</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I love to learn new things all the time so my future company should be a place where learning and sharing knowledge is actively encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel specially motivated in projects where I could create delightful user experiences for great apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also value an open-minded culture, flexibility, a healthy environment, a focused team and companies where technology is the heart.

      <h1>what I'm good at</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I'm good at abstract thinking: explaining and designing how things work and talking to non-technical people. That means I can easily speak with senior architects, product managers, ux researchers or a CTO and I'll be able to have meaningful relations with each one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
           Having a good synthesis capacity and abstract thinking also helps when designing the architecture of apps and systems and when solving difficult problems and defects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm very good at learning new stuff, so when picking up tasks I'll always go for the more challenging ones. That means I also value teams that tend to do pair programming or encourage cross-team work.

              Typeless had this idea of being a contacts aggregator (https://www.producthunt.com/posts/typeless).

            1 year internship in a big consulting firm as a hybrid apps developer/researcher

          <div class="description">
            <p>
              During this 1-year internship in the Smart Mobility working group within the Solutions Delivery and Architecture department at Atos in the central offices in Madrid, I did develop my very first skills as an engineer. Learnt new technologies, researched a lot, took part in several projects, attended courses and, most of all, soaked in a real business environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a non-comprehensive list of some of the things I did:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Design and development of mobile hybrid apps: using Apache Cordova, common web technologies and some specific light frameworks like jQueryMobile.
              </li>
              <li>
                Automated mobile application testing: using Calabash and Cucumber to create a tests written following a BDD approach (Behaviour-Driven Development) which at the time allowed us to both test hybrid and native mobile apps in all platforms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rapid Prototyping: used Axure RP, Appery and Pencil.
              </li>
              <li>
                Web Services testing: i.e. SOAP Web Services using SoapUI.
              </li>
              <li>
                Projects: the most important project was a prototype hybrid Android app for Correos (an important client, the equivalent of Royal Mail UK in Spain) to be used in dedicated tablets in post offices to let customers buy most of the services.
