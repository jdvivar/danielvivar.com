      <p>
        I'm good at <u>abstract thinking</u>: explaining and designing how things work and talking to non-technical people. That means I can easily speak with senior architects, product managers, ux researchers or a CTO and I'll be able to have meaningful relations with each one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That, and a good synthesis capacity also helps when <u>designing the architecture</u> of apps and systems and when solving difficult problems and defects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel motivated by learning new stuff, so when picking up tasks I'll always go for the more <u>challenging</u> ones. That means I also value teams that tend to do pair programming or encourage cross-team work.
