      <p>
        I'm good at <u>abstract thinking</u>: explaining and designing how things work and talking to non-technical people too: from senior architects to product managers, ux researchers or a CTO, and have meaningful conversations with each one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good synthesis capacity also helps when <u>designing the architecture</u> of apps and systems and when solving difficult problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the motivation to learn <em>new stuff</em>, when picking up tasks I'll always go for the more <u>challenging</u> ones. That means teams that tend to do pair programming or encourage cross-team work are important to me as well.
