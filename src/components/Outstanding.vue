      <p>
        I'm really good at <b>abstract thinking</b>: understanding business problems and explaining complex issues to both technical and non-technical colleagues. Also being able to have meaningful conversations with people from every team, experience and level.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also helps when <b>designing the architecture and experiencies</b> of products and when discussing the pros and cons of each solution with colleagues.
      </p>
      <p class="no-print">
        Because of the motivation to learn <em>new stuff</em>, when picking up tasks I'll always go for the more <b>challenging</b> ones. That means teams that tend to do pair programming or encourage cross-team work are important to me as well.
