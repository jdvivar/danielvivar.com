      <p>
        I'm good at <b>abstract thinking</b>: understanding business problems, explaining how things work to others and be a great communicator to both technical and non-technical colleagues. Being able to have meaningful conversations with people from every team, experience and level.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good synthesis capacity also helps when <b>designing the architecture</b> of apps and systems and when solving difficult problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the motivation to learn <em>new stuff</em>, when picking up tasks I'll always go for the more <b>challenging</b> ones. That means teams that tend to do pair programming or encourage cross-team work are important to me as well.
